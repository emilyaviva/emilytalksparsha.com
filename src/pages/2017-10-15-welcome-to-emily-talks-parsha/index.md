Welcome to Emily Talks Parsha! This is where I'm going to be writing about the weekly parasha. After years of being told "Hey, you've got some things to say, you should put them down on the Internets where everyone can read them", I'm going to finally really do it.

This site will get bigger soon. Don't worry. It's very much a work in progress right now. I wanted to get it started before Simchat Torah but that didn't happen, so now I'm playing catch-up.
