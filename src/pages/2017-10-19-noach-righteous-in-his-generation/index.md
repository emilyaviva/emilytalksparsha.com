In the [first verse] of this week's parsha, in introducing the character of Noach, the Torah comments that he was *ish tzaddik*, "a righteous man", *tamim be-dorotav*, "whole" or "perfect in his generation", and that he "walked with God". There is a famous debate between the commentators as to the what this means. Some commentators hold that this means that Noach was righteous only as compared to the other people of his generation, who had begun to make God angry with their wickedness and wrongdoing. But others hold that Noach would have been considered righteous in any generation, and that if he had lived in an age when the moral average was higher, he would have been considered an especially righteous individual.

To examine this we have to look at the unusual phrasing. *Tamim* is a notoriously difficult adjective to translate: it simultaneously means "perfect" or "complete", in a positive sense, but also "simple" in a mildly pejorative sense, as with the "simple (*tam*) child" of the Pesach Seder. The reality is, what may appear to one person to be perfect or complete may appear wanting to another; this is especially true when speaking of personal qualities that are inherently subjective. The narrator of the Torah clearly wants to frame Noach in opposition to the other people of his generation: one good individual in a community of wicked ones. But in our world, we know that it is never that simple. Shades of gray pervade every aspect of our relationships with one another and with our communities and our environments.

When pressed, most people will admit their personal failings, but still somehow believe that it's not them, but everyone else, who *really* has the problem. The mustache-twirling bad guys of cartoons [are just myths]: real people who do bad acts often believe that their acts are actually bad. The challenge for us is separating what is apparent from what is true. In the era of [fake news]—in our generation—it can often seem like an impossible task.

"In a place where there are no people", [says Pirkei Avot], "try to be a person." This doesn't mean only geographically, but also in terms of the community of individuals one is surrounded by. Thus, the question of whether or not Noach was "really" a righteous person is irrelevant.
