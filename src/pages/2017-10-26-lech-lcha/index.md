The first verses of Lech L'cha comprise God's famous pronouncement to Avraham: that having obeyed God's command to go to a new place, away from his father's house, Avraham will be blessed:

> And I will make you a great nation, and I will bless you, and I will make your name great; **and be a blessing**. I will bless those that bless you, and I will curse those that curse you, and all the families of the earth shall bless themselves by you. ([Genesis 12:2–3](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.12.2-3?lang=bi))

The Hebrew phrase *ve-heyeh b'rachah* is often translated "And you shall be a blessing", as in the [well-known song] by the famous Jewish singer-songwriter Debbie Friedman, but translating it this way actually obscures part of the difficulty—and the power—of this verse. It might be more appropriate to translate it as an imperative, rather than simply as a statement of the future or a fulfillment of the condition that God sets forth. God is not simply foretelling what will happen when Avraham accepts his divine mission: the commandment "be a blessing" is something that Avraham must fulfill by his life and his deeds, by exemplifying a certain kind of person, by *doing* rather than by simply *being*.

What does it mean to "be a blessing"? One understanding, as Rashi points out, is that we invoke Avraham's name as actual parts of our blessings: three times a day in the Amidah, when we call upon God in our prayers, we begin by invoking God specifically as the God of Avraham (and of Yitzchak, and of Ya'akov). Another could be that we invoke Avraham as an exemplar of what it is to be a good person: Radak holds that God's blessing of Avraham "spilled over" to those around him to such an extent that we can invoke it on others, as when parents bless their children, "May God bless you with the blessing of Avraham."

Sforno connects this passage to the beautiful and enigmatic story in [Masechet Berachot 7a] that once, on Yom Kippur, God asked the High Priest Rabbi Yishmael for a blessing, and Rabbi Yishmael responded, "May it be Your will that Your compassion conquer Your anger, may Your mercy prevail over Your other attributes, may You act toward Your children with the attribute of compassion, and may You go above and beyond the letter of the law for them." The Gemara relates that God accepted this blessing, and emphasizes that the lesson is that one should not accept a blessing offered to one by an ordinary person (*hed'yot*) lightly or frivolously.

God's commandment to Avraham to "be a blessing" goes to the heart of the question: what does "blessing" mean? In connecting the story Avraham to the story of Rabbi Yishmael, Sforno is emphasizing the Torah's message: a true blessing is one which spreads *shlemut*, "wholeness", among humanity. Certainly one kind of of "wholeness" Sforno meant when he uses the word *shlemut* is "monotheism", but I would extend it even further: a true blessing is one that unites, one that levels the distinctions between people. By invoking Avraham as a blessing, we remind ourselves that blessings need not originate solely from the transcendent divine: they can also come out of the world of the *hed'yot*, the ordinary person, and that blessings such as these should not be dismissed or thought of as extraneous or irrelevant, but instead embraced as contributing to the wholeness of the world.
